## The Problem
Other react starter kits are either a black box, require setup on the users part that is more or less the same for every project, or both. I wanted to create my own project boilerplate, to learn how its done, and to make a more consistent react starter kit for myself.

## The Solution
A `Fresh` React Boilerplate is a complete package, ready to use without any additional setup after installation.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/helloalexdodd/a-fresh-react-boilerplate.git
```
